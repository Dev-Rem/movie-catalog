My project is a web application that lists various kind of movies from a database
using ASP.NET CORE. The app allows for adding of movies to be displayed and it also allows modifying and deletion
of added movies.


To create a .NET web application you need a project folder
Open Terminal on Mac or Git bash on Windows and "cd" into project folder and run this command
"dotnet new mvc -o MvcMovie" to create an MVC web project. I am using the visual studio code IDE.
To open the project in the IDE run the command "code -r MvcMovie" Terminal on Mac or Git bash on Windows,
everything is setup for development.
